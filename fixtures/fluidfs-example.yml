# This is an example configuration for FluidFS
# Modify to your local settings, rename and place in one of the following:
#
#   - /etc/fluidfs/fluidfs.yml
#   - ~/.fluidfs/fluidfs.yml
#   - $(pwd)/fluidfs.yml
#
# Note is preferable to store configurations in /etc/fluidfs

# If debug is true, then the app will behave in a debugging fashion
debug: true

# The process id (or precedence id) must be unique across all replicas and
# determines presidence during version conflicts.
pid: null

# The hostname of the local device (must be unique)
hostname: null

# The IP address of the local device to listen for connections on.
# Note that this must be a well formed IP address, and can contain an optional
# port number at the end. IP addresses are resolved as follows:
#   192.168.1.1:0 --> 192.169.1.1:4157
#   null  --> autoip:4157
#   :4444 --> autoip:4444
# where autoip automatically detects the external ip address of the machine
# and the default port of the app is 4157.
# Note that when using autoip, other replicas must be notified of the address.
addr: ":4157"
