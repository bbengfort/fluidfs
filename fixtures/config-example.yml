# This is an example configuration for FluidFS
# Modify to your local settings, rename and place in one of the following:
#
#   - /etc/fluidfs/config.yml
#   - ~/.fluidfs/config.yml
#   - $(pwd)/fluidfs.yml
#
# Note is preferable to store configurations in ~/.fluidfs/config.yml

# The process id (or precedence id) must be unique across all replicas and
# determines presidence during version conflicts.
pid: 0

# The replica name (must be unique), usually the hostname of the device.
# Note if Name is null it will be set to the hostname of the device.
# name: null

# The IP address or hostname of the replica to listen for connections on.
# Note that this must be a well formed IP address, but should not contain a
# port number suffixed to the address. If null is supplied then FluidFS will
# do its best to detect the external IP address of the machine and use that.
# host: null

# The port to listen on, the default port is 4157.
port: 4157

# Configuration for application logging
logging:

    # The log level can be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR or FATAL
    level: INFO

    # Specify a path to log to a file, if null or empty will log to stdout
    # path: null

# Configuration for the state cache database
database:

    # The driver for the database, either boltdb (default) or leveldb
    driver: boltdb

    # The path to the database file on disk. If null or omitted, the database
    # will be created in the user home directory at ~/.fluid/cache.bdb
    # path: null

# Configuration for blob storage and chunking
storage:

    # The path on disk to store data blobs. If null or omitted, the storage
    # directory will be created in the user home directory at ~/.fluid/data/
    # Note that this path will be created if it doesn't exist and that the user
    # must have access permissions to it or the FluidFS daemon will not start.
    # path: null

    # Select either variable (default) or fixed length chunking
    chunking: variable

    # Set the block size in bytes. This is the target block size for variable
    # length chunking and the size of all chunks (except possibly the last)
    # for fixed length chunking.
    block_size: 4096

    # Set the minimum block size in bytes. This is used in both variable and
    # fixed length chunking. In fixed length chunking it determines whether or
    # the last block is greater than or small than the block_size.
    min_block_size: 2048

    # Set the maximal blcok size in bytes. This is only used in variable
    # length chunking to bound the size of the rolling window. If using fixed
    # length chunking, set this equal to the block size.
    max_block_size: 8192

    # Specify the hashing algorithm to use. This algorithm determines how
    # chunks are uniquely identified by their signature. Different hashing
    # algorithms have different opportunities for security, performance, and
    # collision avoidance. The default is sha256. Current options for hashing
    # include:  md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, and murmur.
    # Future algorithms to include are: CityHash, FarmHash, and SipHash.
    hashing: sha256
