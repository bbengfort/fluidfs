FluidFS is a research project to create a distributed file system in user space (FUSE) that is highly consistent and reliable. It is meant as a Dropbox replacement, allowing direct synchronization between devices on a personal network rather than going through a cloud service.

In practice, FluidFS is a research project to create a distributed file system in user space (FUSE) that is highly consistent and reliable. It is meant as a Dropbox replacement, allowing direct synchronization between devices on a personal network rather than going through a cloud service. Strong consistency is provided through a novel approach to distributed coordination called _hierarchical consensus_.
