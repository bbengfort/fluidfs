# Changelog

The release versions that are  tagged in Github. You can see the tags through the Github web application and download the binary of the version you'd like. Note that for many operating systems you'll have to compile for your local architecture (linux and darwin supported).

The versioning uses a three part version system, "a.b.c" - "a" represents a major release that may not be backwards compatible. "b" is incremented on minor releases that may contain extra features, but are backwards compatible. "c" releases are bug fixes or other micro changes that developers should feel free to immediately update to.
